					Add hashes that pass from LevelStarted to LevelCompleted for identification		
							
					LevelCompleted should specifically contain:		
						Accuracy/Score in range from 0-100	
						Duration from start to end (seconds as float is fine)	
						Level name/difficulty (ex. 5-5, Medium)	
							
					If your game does not adhere to any of these standards:		
						We will update the data team (Abbie, Suman, Justin) as soon as possible	
							
						They'll help us come up with alternatives
